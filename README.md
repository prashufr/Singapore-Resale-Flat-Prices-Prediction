# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Prediction 

Problem Statement:

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model will utilize historical data of resale flat transactions to assist both potential buyers and sellers in accurately estimating the resale value of a flat.

Motivation:

The resale flat market in Singapore is highly dynamic and competitive, making it challenging for individuals to determine the accurate resale value of their flat. Various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration significantly influence resale prices. By creating a predictive model, we can provide users with a reliable estimation of resale prices based on these factors, thus simplifying the decision-making process for buyers and sellers.

Scope:

The project encompasses the following tasks:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a comprehensive dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) spanning from 1990 to the present. Preprocess the dataset to remove inconsistencies and format it appropriately for machine learning analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commencement date. Additionally, create any supplementary features that may enhance the predictive accuracy of the model.

Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate regression model from available options such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests. Train the selected model using a portion of the dataset to predict resale prices accurately.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using regression evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score to ensure its effectiveness in predicting resale prices.

Streamlit Web Application: Develop an intuitive web application using Streamlit that enables users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.). Integrate the trained machine learning model into the application to provide users with instant predictions of resale prices based on their inputs.

Deployment on Render: Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any suitable cloud platform to make it easily accessible to users across the internet.

Testing and Validation: Conduct rigorous testing of the deployed application to verify its functionality and ensure that it delivers accurate predictions consistently.

Deliverables:

The project will produce the following deliverables:

A robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting resale prices of flats in Singapore.
A user-friendly web application developed with Streamlit, Flask, or Django, deployed on a suitable cloud platform for easy access.
Comprehensive documentation and user instructions to guide individuals on utilizing the application effectively.
A detailed project report summarizing the data analysis, model development process, and deployment procedures.

Results:

This project will provide invaluable assistance to both buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market by offering them a reliable tool for estimating resale prices. Buyers can make informed decisions based on predicted prices, while sellers can gain insights into the potential market value of their flats. Moreover, the project showcases the practical application of machine learning techniques in real estate and web development domains.
